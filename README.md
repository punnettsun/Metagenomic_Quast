### Metagenomic_Quast
##### QUAST results were obtained from metagenomic assembly using SPAdes and MetaSPAdes. Each microbiome (CORAL & GUT) folder contain 6 tsv files each with assembly metrics & their values as columns. Program allows user to choose which microbiome and specific QUAST metric to assess. Then the program will create a bar graph representing that metric across both tools and kmer sizes.
##### Make sure the directory path is the path where CORAL and GUT folders are located. Ex: /Users/punitsundar/Documents/Metagenomic_Data
